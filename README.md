# Credit card fraud classifier
For this classifier, logistic regression was used to identify a positive case of credit card fraud from a negative case. 
The sensitivity, recall, and accuracy are all calculated to assess the performance of the classifier.
A ROC curve was used to also determine how much better this classifier does than the test case (50%).

#
I am currently working on another random forest classifier for practice.
